    "text": "Coral reefs are home to 25% of all marine biodiversity, yet cover only 0.07% of the Earth’s surface. Despite their importance, reefs around the world have experienced unprecedented levels of thermal heat stress in the past decade due to man-made climate change, thus threatening their long-term survival. The central question is thus: Will corals of the Great Barrier Reef evolve fast enough to keep pace with climate change?\nUsing explicit models of population genetics to represent coral evolution with realistic size-dependent demography, my aim is to understand the likely population evolutionary trajectories of corals in response to the increasing temperatures predicted by climate change. Understanding rates of natural adaptation vs. artificially enhanced coral adaptationis key to conserving scleractinian (hard) corals in an era of more frequent and intense mass coral bleaching events.\nPreliminary model results suggest that it is a mixed bag for different corals, with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for coral communities overall if we as humans fail to reduce our carbon emissions in the near future."

    "text": "Hi! I’m Kevin, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Queensland studying the eco-evolutionary dynamics of coral populations along the Great Barrier Reef! For the past five years, I have worked on understanding coral population responses to climate change.\n\nThe overarching question of my PhD was:\nWill coral evolution be able to keep pace with climate change?\nThe results suggest that outcomes are likely to vary across the GBR, with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for all coral communities if we fail to reduce our carbon emissions in the near future. The models I am building currently using explicit genetics and size-dependent dynamics share this result!"
