I serendipitously ended up on the path of a marine biologist studying corals of the Great Barrier Reef despite originating from the landlocked prairies of Canada. For the past five years, I have worked on understanding coral population responses to climate change using state-of-the-art eco-evolutionary models of coral thermal tolerance.<br></br>

The overarching question of my PhD was: \
**Will coral evolution be able to keep pace with climate change?** \
My results suggest that it is a mixed bag for different corals, with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for coral communities overall if we as humans fail to reduce our carbon emissions in the near future.
