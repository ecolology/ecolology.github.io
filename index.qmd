Hi! I'm Kevin, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Queensland studying the eco-evolutionary dynamics of coral populations along the Great Barrier Reef! For the past five years, I have worked on understanding coral population responses to climate change.\

The overarching question of my PhD was:\
**Will coral evolution be able to keep pace with climate change?**\
The results suggest that outcomes are likely to vary across the GBR, with an increasingly pessimistic outlook for all coral communities if we fail to reduce our carbon emissions in the near future. The models I am building currently using explicit genetics and size-dependent dynamics share this result!
